chinese-flashcards
==================

Anki flashcards started during Chinese 101 at the University of Washington in Fall 2014

These cards were created on Lubuntu 13.10 with Anki 2.0.11

For full review, enter deck options, create a group that shows new cards in random order and maximize the number of new cards per day, then apply group to all subdecks

Revision history will be added before the 102 deck is created

Enjoy!
